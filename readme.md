# Quantitative Reasoning Content Areas - README

## Overview

Some of the Quantitative Reasoning questions are posed in real-life settings, while others are posed in purely mathematical settings. Many of the questions are "word problems," which must be translated and modeled mathematically. The skills, concepts, and abilities are assessed in the four content areas below.

## Content Areas

### 1. Arithmetic

- Properties and types of integers: divisibility, factorization, prime numbers, remainders, and odd and even integers.
- Arithmetic operations, exponents, and roots.
- Concepts such as estimation, percent, ratio, rate, absolute value, the number line, decimal representation, and sequences of numbers.

### 2. Algebra

- Operations with exponents.
- Factoring and simplifying algebraic expressions.
- Relations, functions, equations, and inequalities.
- Solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities.
- Solving simultaneous equations and inequalities.
- Setting up equations to solve word problems.
- Coordinate geometry: graphs of functions, equations, and inequalities, intercepts, and slopes of lines.

### 3. Geometry

- Parallel and perpendicular lines.
- Circles.
- Triangles, including isosceles, equilateral, and 30°-60°-90° triangles.
- Quadrilaterals.
- Other polygons.
- Congruent and similar figures.
- 3-dimensional figures.
- Area.
- Perimeter.
- Volume.
- The Pythagorean theorem.
- Angle measurement in degrees.
- The ability to construct proofs is not tested.

### 4. Data Analysis

- Basic descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, interquartile range, quartiles, and percentiles.
- Interpretation of data in tables and graphs: line graphs, bar graphs, circle graphs, boxplots, scatterplots, and frequency distributions.
- Elementary probability: probabilities of compound events and independent events.
- Conditional probability.
- Random variables and probability distributions, including normal distributions.
- Counting methods: combinations, permutations, and Venn diagrams.

These topics are typically taught in high school algebra courses or introductory statistics courses.
